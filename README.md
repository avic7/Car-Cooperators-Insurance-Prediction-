# Car Cooperators Insurance Prediction 
Data Science - Classification Project 

The project aims to predict whether the client will buy Insurance or not i.e. predicting ‘IS_BOUND” 
variable in our dataset. To help us with our predictions we will train two models Logistic Regression 
and Random Forest and predict them on test dataset.  
After comparing, Random Forest outperforms Logistic Regression in several key areas, including 
higher accuracy (78% vs. 51%) and AUC score (0.65 vs. 0.64), indicating better overall classification 
and differentiation between the classes. While Random Forest has a higher false negative rate (39% 
vs. 36%), it compensates with a lower false positive rate (40% vs. 44%) and generates more advertising 
revenue (16 vs. 15). Despite its recall being zero, its stronger metrics make Random Forest the superior 
choice, particularly when prioritizing overall accuracy and AUC score over minimizing false 
negatives.
